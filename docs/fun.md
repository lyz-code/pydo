The `fun` optional task attribute registers how much light-hearted pleasure,
enjoyment, or amusement does the execution of the task gives.

As with [willpower](willpower.md), if your tasks have this property, it can help
you determine the tasks to be done during the sprint and in what order so as not
to burn yourself out.

To set the value of a task use the `fun` keyword:

```
$: pydo add Go hiking fun:4
  [+] Added task 6: Go hiking
```

As with the [priority](priority.md), I use a range of values from `0` to `5` but
the parameter allows any integer.
